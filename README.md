# MNIST-DIGIT-RECOGNITION
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.
It contains 70,000 grayscale images:
60,000 training images
10,000 test images
Each image is 28x28 pixels, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 (grayscale intensity).
Goal
The goal is to classify each image into one of 10 classes, representing digits from 0 to 9.

Why is it Popular?
Simplicity: Small dataset, easy to process.
Benchmark: Widely used for benchmarking classification algorithms.
Versatility: Applicable in deep learning, neural networks, and other ML techniques.
Approaches
Traditional Machine Learning:
Feature extraction (e.g., using pixel intensities, edges).
Classifiers like SVMs, k-Nearest Neighbors, etc.
Deep Learning:
Fully Connected Neural Networks: Dense layers for classification.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Better accuracy by capturing spatial features.
Performance:
Baseline accuracy with simple methods: ~92%.
Advanced deep learning models (e.g., CNNs): ~99% accuracy.
